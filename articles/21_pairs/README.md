This is a set of Latvian articles identified by an Estonian journalist that are relevant as the starting point for the cross-border interesting news analysis challenge.

The set consists of 20 Latvian articles from 2018-19 that have gained popularity among Estonian readers and can be used for preliminary analysis.

Links to the original sources of Latvian and Estonian articles are also provided (Estonian versions are edited, not 100% translated).

There is also a JSON file containing automatically collected texts (title, body, description, url, as well as links to related articles) by crawling the corresponding links. In any case, the majority of these articles should also be present in the database of Latvian articles.
