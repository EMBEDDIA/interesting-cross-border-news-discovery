# EMBEDDIA Hackathon

We are trying to detect news articles from foreign countries (especially neighboring ones) that would be interesting to readers from the target country.
We are focusing on Estonian articles and articles from neighboring countries that would be interesting to Estonians.
We will start by exploring the following ideas:
1) How to bring articles in different languages to a single space. We could use multilingual models, try to translate articles, articles from Estonia and neighboring countries come with a Russian translation, which we could use as our unified space.
2) Detect named entities in articles and connect foreign articles to native ones based on them.
3) Extract keywords from articles or compare article tags to foreign articles, similar to native ones.
